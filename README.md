# Facial Recognition and Image Processing

This project implements various facial recognition and image processing features using machine learning techniques. The features include face detection, face recognition, facial landmark detection, emotion detection, 3D face reconstruction, and face anti-spoofing.

## Features

1. **Face Detection**: Identify and locate faces within an image.
2. **Face Recognition**: Match detected faces to known faces in a database.
3. **Facial Landmark Detection**: Identify key points on a face (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth).
4. **Emotion Detection**: Recognize facial expressions to determine emotions.
5. **3D Face Reconstruction**: Create a 3D model of a face from a 2D image.
6. **Face Anti-Spoofing**: Detect and prevent spoofing attacks using photos or videos.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/omgitsbees/facial_recognition.git
    cd facial_recognition
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Data Collection

Load images from a folder:
```python
folder_path = 'path_to_your_image_folder'
images = load_images_from_folder(folder_path)
```

### Data Preprocessing

Preprocess images for model input:
```python
processed_images = preprocess_images(images)
```

### Model Training

Train the image classification model:
```python
# Assuming you have labels and processed_images
model.fit(processed_images, labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

### Face Detection

Detect faces in an image:
```python
faces = detect_faces(image)
```

### Face Recognition

Train the face recognition model:
```python
recognizer, le = train_face_recognition_model(embeddings, labels)
```

### Facial Landmark Detection

Detect facial landmarks in an image:
```python
landmarks = detect_facial_landmarks(image, faces)
```

### Emotion Detection

Detect emotions from a face:
```python
emotion = detect_emotions(face)
```

### 3D Face Reconstruction

Reconstruct a 3D face from a 2D image:
```python
reconstructed_face = reconstruct_3d_face(image)
```

### Face Anti-Spoofing

Build and train the anti-spoofing model:
```python
anti_spoofing_model = build_anti_spoofing_model()
train_anti_spoofing_model(anti_spoofing_model, train_data, train_labels)
```

Detect spoofing in an image:
```python
is_spoof = detect_spoofing(image, anti_spoofing_model)
```

### Model Conversion

Convert the Keras model to Core ML:
```python
coreml_model = coremltools.converters.convert(model, input_names=['image'], output_names=['output'])
coreml_model.save('ImageRecognitionModel.mlmodel')
```
